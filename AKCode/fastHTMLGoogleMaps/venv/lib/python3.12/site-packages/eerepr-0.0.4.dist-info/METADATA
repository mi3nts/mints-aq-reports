Add interactive Code Editor-style HTML reprs to Earth Engine objects in a Jupyter environment.

## Setup

Install from PyPI:

```bash
$ pip install eerepr
```

Install from Conda-Forge:

```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge eerepr
```

## Usage

```python
import eerepr
```

Importing `eerepr` in a Jupyter notebook adds an HTML repr method to all Earth Engine objects. When you print them, you'll see an interactive HTML repr instead of a boring old string repr. Simple as that!

> **Note**
> Just like in the Code Editor, printing huge collections can be slow and may hit memory limits.

## Caching

`eerepr` uses caching to improve performance. Server data will only be requested once for each unique Earth Engine object, and all subsequent requests will be retrieved from the cache until the Jupyter session is restarted.

When you import `eerepr`, it is automatically initialized with an unlimited cache size. You can manually set the number of unique objects to cache using `eerepr.initialize(max_cache_size=n)`. A value of `None` sets an unlimited cache while a value of `0` disables caching.
